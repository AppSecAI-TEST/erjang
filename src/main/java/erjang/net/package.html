<p>This package contains a BSD/Posix-like socket abstraction, which maps to Java's notion
of sockets.  The issue is that the call sequence required by Erlang/OTP does not map
well to the fact that Java supports ServerSocket and Socket; a distinction which has 
to be made before the socket is bound and/or socket options are set.</p>

<p>So with the sockets described in this package, you first create a LazySocket, which assembles
the options and the port binding, and then whey you say either listen() or connect(), then the 
supporting ServerSocket or Socket (respectively) is created, and the previously given options
and port binding are applied.  This has the (bad) side effect that bind() does not actuall bind the
socket, and thus if you bind(0) you will not know the actual port bound, as also binding to 
a specific port, say bind(80) does not fail (if there is a conflict) until you later issue
either a connect() or a listen().
</p>

<p>Even with this restriction, it seems to fit well with the calling sequences in Erlang</p>
